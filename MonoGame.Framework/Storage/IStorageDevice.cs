(B) If you bring a patent claim against any contributor over patents that you claim are infringed by the software, 
your patent license from such contributor to the software ends automatically.
(C) If you distribute any portion of the software, you must retain all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution 
notices that are present in the software.
(D) If you distribute any portion of the software in source code form, you may do so only under this license by including
